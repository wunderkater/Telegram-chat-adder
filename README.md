# Telegram-chat-adder
Many tech companies have work chats that new hires must join. Spam protection in Telegram does not allow you to immediately add an employee to all chats, throttling is enabled. The script automates this process and adds the employee to all work chats. It is enough to record work chats in file once, and each new employee can spend time adapting and learning while the script does its work in the background!
